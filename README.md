Izzy Engine is a complete recreation of Friday Night Funkin'. Think of it as [opsu!](https://github.com/itdelatrisu/opsu) but for Friday Night Funkin', with great customizability in mind.

My goal is to make a framework that is accessible, easy to use, and close to the original as possible, with a sprinkle of fixes and quality of life features.

## Features Planned and Implemented

- [X] Un-hardcode characters with .json **[Completed]**
